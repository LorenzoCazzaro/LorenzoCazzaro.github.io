As of August 2023, I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Università Ca' Foscari Venezia](https://www.unive.it/) under the supervision of [prof. Stefano Calzavara](https://www.dais.unive.it/~calzavara/).

I obtained a Master's Degree in Computer Science in July 2021 (Best Master Thesis in Computer Science for the a.y. 2020/21 at Università Ca' Foscari Venezia and a finalist for the Best Master Thesis Awards on Big Data & Data Science 2022 of the 1st Italian Conference on Big Data and Data Science) and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in November 2019 (Best first-year student of the Bachelor's Degree program).

You can find an updated copy of my resume [here](https://lorenzocazzaro.github.io/cv/ResumeCazzaro.pdf).

My research activity during the Ph.D. focuses on the verification of properties of Machine Learning (ML) models. 

Moreover, I am also interested in the following research topics and I am currently working on them:

- Applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms in Cybersecurity.
- Adversarial Machine Learning.

If you are interested in some of the topics on which I'm working or on some of my publications or you would simply like to contact me, the best way to reach me is by email [lorenzo.cazzaro@unive.it](mailto:lorenzo.cazzaro@unive.it) or Twitter!

I am always looking for motivated students who enjoy working on the research topics in which I'm interested! If you want to discuss details about possible topics for a Bachelor's and Master's thesis, feel free to drop me an email!
