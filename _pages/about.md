As of November 2025, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Luxembourg - SnT](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/), in particular in the [SerVal group](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/research-groups/serval/), under the supervision of prof. [Maxime Cordy](https://maxcordy.github.io/).
I was previously a postdoctoral researcher at [Università Ca' Foscari Venezia](https://www.unive.it/) under the supervision of [prof. Stefano Calzavara](https://www.dais.unive.it/~calzavara/) and [prof. Salvatore Orlando](https://www.unive.it/data/people/5592727). I also spent a period at [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en) as an intern under the supervision of [prof. Giancarlo Pellegrino](https://trouge.net/group/).

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science with honors from Università Ca' Foscari Venezia in March 2025 under the supervision of [prof. Stefano Calzavara](https://www.dais.unive.it/~calzavara/). I also obtained a Master's Degree in Computer Science in July 2021 (Best Master Thesis in Computer Science for the a.y. 2020/21 at Università Ca' Foscari Venezia and a finalist for the Best Master Thesis Awards on Big Data & Data Science 2022 of the 1st Italian Conference on Big Data and Data Science) and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in November 2019 (Best first-year student of the Bachelor's Degree program).

You can find my DBLP page [here](https://dblp.org/pid/294/3340.html).

My research activities focus on Machine Learning (ML) Security:
- Verification of security properties of ML models. 
- Adversarial Machine Learning.
- Machine Learning models watermarking and data exfiltration.
- Applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms in Cybersecurity.

If you are interested in some of the topics on which I'm working or on some of my publications or you would simply like to contact me, the best way to reach me is by email [lorenzo.cazzaro@unive.it](mailto:lorenzo.cazzaro@unive.it) or Twitter!

I am always looking for motivated students who enjoy working on the research topics I'm interested in! If you want to discuss details about possible topics for a Bachelor's or Master's thesis, feel free to email me!
