I have joined the [University of Luxembourg - SnT](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/) as a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Maxime Cordy](https://maxcordy.github.io/)'s fantastic team! I will continue working on security and privacy aspects of Machine Learning, in particular in the context of applications to tabular data!
