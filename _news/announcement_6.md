Our paper _Less is More: Boosting Coverage of Web Crawling through Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit_ has been accepted at [DSN 2025](https://dsn2025.github.io/)! In this work, we propose a new state-agnostic Reinforcement Learning-based crawler that applies Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit in a smart way to improve the exploration of web applications, surpassing the limitations of previous crawlers based on Reinforcement Learning. Available soon!
