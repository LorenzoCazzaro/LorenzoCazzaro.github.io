Our paper [Verifiable Boosted Tree Ensembles](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2025/223600a022/21B7QdnSnoQ) has been accepted at [IEEE S&P 2025](https://sp2025.ieee-security.org/)! In this work, we demonstrate how to train boosted tree ensembles with robustness guarantees that can be efficiently verified in polynomial time, overcoming the challenge of robustness verification, which is NP-hard for tree ensembles in general.
